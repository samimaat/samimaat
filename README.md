# Intro
Hi, I’m @samimaat and I have graduated from being a hobbyist. I champion digital accessibility and I like lightweight, minimal websites. You can check out my personal site [samimaatta.fi](https://samimaatta.fi). It's built with [Eleventy](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy) and deployed with Netlify.

## Interests
Nowadays I'm dabbling in frontend development and accessible data visualization is very interesting to me! Not much development on my part tho. 

I know HTML and CSS through my job in accessible publishing, but I want to learn more about it on the web.

## Recently
I have been thinking about a redesign on my personal website, but I haven't been able to get to it! Check out my personal website and the [Helsinki pedestrians' association's website (in Finnish)](https://jalankulkijat.fi) if you want to see some of my work.

## Contact
Check out [my contact info](https://samimaatta.fi/#socials) from my website.
