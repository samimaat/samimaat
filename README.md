# Intro
Hi, I’m @samimaat and I'm pretty much a hobbyist. You can check out my personal site [samimaatta.fi](https://samimaatta.fi). It's built with @11ty, deployed with Netlify and hosted by Domainhotelli.

## Interests
I’m interested in web development (fullstack when possible), so I dabble in code challenges. Now I have been mostly working on my own website. My work is in accessible digital publishing, so I am also learning about accessibility in the web. The formats are the same (HTML).

## Recently
I just recently finished my Twitter bot that will begin tweeting out energy saving tips.

## Contact
Check out [my contact info](https://samimaatta.fi/#socials) from my website.
